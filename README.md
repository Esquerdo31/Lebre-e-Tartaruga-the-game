Update-6
One of the biggest updates I've pushed so far, everything is looking great now!
There are a couple of decks still missing but the basics for the game are complete(except one deck"I need to sleep will do it tomorrow").
Fixed various bugs, now the biggest challenge will be setting the rules and the table
You will also see new functions to make the process of internal verification while the game is still in the early development.
Any doubts you can always contact me throughtout my Instagram(GitHub bio)

# Lebre-e-Tartaruga-the-game

Hello,
This is a free work so be at will grab some lines and use it on yoursðŸ˜Š

Work in progress after finishing will leave it for other people to see at it
I'm a new student at University of TrÃ¡s os Montes e Alto Douro also known as UTAD
This project is being developed for a class called laboratory of programming
The project itself is a game that almost everyone knows called the The Turtle and the Hare but with some twists like new characters

Still new to this GitHub thing but trying hard to understand it, will try to upload every change I make to the work to see what I've done and what could be better.

I've made quiet new changes to the program so just go to master and search for the latest update! (1/12/2023).
