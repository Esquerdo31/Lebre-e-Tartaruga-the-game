# Lebre-e-Tartaruga-the-game

Hello,
This is a free work so be at will grab some lines and use it on yoursðŸ˜Š

Work in progress after finishing will leave it for other people to see at it
I'm a new student at University of TrÃ¡s os Montes e Alto Douro also known as UTAD
This project is being developed for a class called laboratory of programming
The project itself is a game that almost everyone knows called the The Turtle and the Hare but with some twists like new characters

Still new to this GitHub thing but trying hard to understand it, will try to upload every change I make to the work to see what I've done and what could be better
