One of the biggest updates I've pushed so far, everything is looking great now!
There are a couple of decks still missing but the basics for the game are complete(except one deck"I need to sleep will do it tomorrow").
Fixed various bugs, now the biggest challenge will be setting the rules and the table
You will also see new functions to make the process of internal verification while the game is still in the early development.
Any doubts you can always contact me throughtout my Instagram(GitHub bio)
